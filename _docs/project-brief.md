# Gauntlet AI Open Source Project
## Building Industry-Specific AI Agents

## üéØ Introduction

Contributing to the open source AI community is a rite of passage for anyone who calls themselves an AI engineer. Open source software has pioneered new inventions and techniques that have supercharged tech as a whole.

### The Software Paradigm Shift

As Andrej Karpathy outlined, we're living through a fundamental transition in software development:

- **Software 1.0:** Traditional Code
- **Software 2.0:** Neural Networks  
- **Software 3.0:** LLM Programming

We're in the "1960s era" of LLM computing - expensive but revolutionary. LLMs function as a new kind of operating system, and we're building the applications that run on top of them.

### Why Cursor Succeeded

Cursor achieved what Karpathy calls "Software 3.0" - they built an LLM application that:

- Manages context intelligently (solving the "anterograde amnesia" problem)
- Uses AI for generation while humans handle verification
- Works in incremental chunks with visual interfaces
- Maintains humans in the loop for complex software decisions

Your goal is to bring this "Cursor experience" to another industry - building an AI agent that understands context, makes intelligent decisions, and automates complex workflows while keeping humans in the verification loop.

## üìã The Task

**Objective:** Build and launch an open source AI agent that brings the "Cursor experience" to a specific industry.

**Core Concept:** Think "How can I bring the Cursor experience to X?" where X is your chosen industry. Your agent should be autonomous - able to understand context, make intelligent decisions, and take action - while being designed for human verification and guidance.

## üìè Guidelines

### Industry Selection

- Choose a specific industry or profession (healthcare, legal, finance, education, design, marketing, etc.)
- Identify workflows that suffer from "context window amnesia" - where professionals lose track of info across complex processes
- Look for domains where "AI does generation, humans do verification" makes sense
- Find opportunities where visual interfaces can speed up verification processes

### The Agent Design Framework

Using Karpathy's insights, your agent should:

- **Context Management:** Solve the "anterograde amnesia" problem by maintaining relevant context across workflows
- **Generation + Verification:** AI handles the heavy lifting, humans verify and guide decisions
- **Incremental Processing:** Work in small, manageable chunks that humans can easily review
- **Visual Interface:** Create interfaces that make verification fast and intuitive
- **Partial Autonomy:** Build "autonomy sliders" - let users control how much the agent does independently

### Technical Requirements

- Context Management: Intelligent handling of relevant information across multi-step workflows
- Generation + Verification Pattern: AI generates, humans verify and guide
- Incremental Processing: Break complex tasks into reviewable chunks
- Visual Verification Interface: Make human oversight fast and intuitive
- Partial Autonomy Controls: Allow users to adjust how much the agent does independently
- Clean, well-documented code with proper GitHub repository
- Open source license (MIT, Apache 2.0, etc.)

### Avoid These Pitfalls

- Don't build fully autonomous systems (software is tricky, keep humans in the loop)
- Don't ignore context management (this is what makes or breaks LLM applications)
- Don't make verification slow or text-heavy (use visual interfaces)
- Don't try to solve everything (work in small, incremental chunks)

### Development Process

- **MVP:** Research industry + define agent capabilities
- **CORE:** Build core agent functionality
- **POLISH:** Integration, testing, and documentation

### Team Collaboration

- All members must contribute meaningfully to the codebase
- Use proper version control with meaningful commits
- Assign clear roles and responsibilities

## üöÄ Getting Started

1. **Choose Your Industry:** Research and select your target industry
2. **Define Your Agent:** Focus on one workflow that suffers from context loss and needs generation + verification
3. **Build Context Management:** Start with how your agent will maintain relevant information across the workflow

## üí° Success Tips

- **Context First:** Build an agent that remembers and uses relevant information across complex workflows
- **Visual Interfaces:** Create interfaces that make verification fast - text is hard to read and interpret
- **Incremental Wins:** Perfect one workflow that can be broken into reviewable chunks
- **Autonomy with Control:** Give users control over how much the agent does independently

**Remember:** We're in the "decade of agents" but software is still tricky. Focus on partial autonomy products with autonomy sliders. The goal is to amplify human capability, not replace human judgment. üöÄ
