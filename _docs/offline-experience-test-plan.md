### **Scenario 2: Driving to Job Site - Intermittent Connection**
**Context**: Tradesperson drives to job site, experiencing varying connection quality

**Test Steps**:
1. ✅ Enable airplane mode to simulate poor connection
2. ✅ Observe OfflineExperienceBar transitions to "Offline" state
3. ✅ Navigate between Jobs, Inventory, and Map tabs
4. ✅ Verify all screens show consistent offline status
5. ✅ Disable airplane mode to simulate reconnection
6. ✅ Verify smooth transition back to "Online" state

**Expected Results**:
- ✅ Status bar immediately shows red "Offline" indicator
- ✅ All tabs display offline status consistently
- ✅ No loss of functionality during offline state
- ✅ Smooth transition to online when reconnected
- ✅ Connection quality service resumes monitoring

### **Scenario 3: At Job Site - Offline Job Management**
**Context**: Tradesperson at job site with poor/no cellular connection, needs to manage job status

**Test Steps**:
1. ✅ Enable airplane mode (simulate no connection at job site)
2. ✅ Navigate to Jobs tab
3. ✅ Attempt to create a new job entry
4. ✅ Verify job creation works offline (shows in list)
5. ✅ Check OfflineExperienceBar for pending operations count
6. ✅ Try to edit existing job details
7. ✅ Verify offline operations are queued

**Expected Results**:
- ✅ Job creation works seamlessly offline
- ✅ New job appears in list immediately (optimistic update)
- ✅ Status bar shows pending operations count increasing
- ✅ Job edits are accepted and queued
- ✅ No user-facing errors or blocking dialogs

---

### **Scenario 4: Inventory Management - Stock Updates**
**Context**: Tradesperson uses materials and needs to update inventory levels

**Test Steps**:
1. ✅ With airplane mode enabled (offline)
2. ✅ Navigate to Inventory tab
3. ✅ Attempt to update quantity for multiple items
4. ✅ Try to add new inventory items
5. ✅ Verify inventory changes are reflected immediately
6. ✅ Check pending operations count increases

**Expected Results**:
- ✅ Inventory updates work offline
- ✅ Quantity changes visible immediately
- ✅ New items appear in inventory list
- ✅ Pending operations counter reflects queued changes
- ✅ No blocking errors or failed operations

---

### **Scenario 5: End of Day - Bulk Synchronization**
**Context**: Tradesperson finishes work day, returns to good connection, triggers sync

**Test Steps**:
1. ✅ Disable airplane mode (simulate returning to good connection)
2. ✅ Observe OfflineExperienceBar transition to "Online"
3. ✅ Watch pending operations count decrease as sync occurs
4. ✅ Verify all offline changes are synchronized
5. ✅ Check for any failed operations that need retry
6. ✅ Validate data consistency across all tabs

**Expected Results**:
- ✅ Status bar shows "Online" with connection quality
- ✅ Pending operations count decreases to zero
- ✅ All offline changes successfully synchronized
- ✅ No failed operations requiring manual retry
- ✅ Data consistency maintained across all screens

---

### **Scenario 6: Network Quality Variations**
**Context**: Test app behavior under different connection qualities

**Test Steps**:
1. ✅ Test with strong WiFi (should show "Excellent" quality)
2. ✅ Test with cellular 4G (should show "Good" quality)
3. ✅ Test with poor cellular (should show "Poor" quality)
4. ✅ Verify adaptive batching behavior
5. ✅ Observe connection quality metrics (speed, latency)
6. ✅ Validate automatic batch size adjustments

**Expected Results**:
- ✅ Quality levels accurately reflect actual connection
- ✅ Batch sizes adapt to connection quality
- ✅ Processing delays adjust based on quality
- ✅ Speed and latency metrics are reasonable
- ✅ Quality changes trigger batch optimization
