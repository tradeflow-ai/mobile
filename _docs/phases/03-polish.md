# Phase 3: Polish & Advanced Features

## ðŸŽ¯ Goal
To elevate the MVP into a polished, delightful, and production-ready application. This phase focuses on refining the user experience, improving performance, adding advanced "autonomy" features, and ensuring the application is robust and scalable.

##  deliverables
- A refined and delightful user interface with smooth transitions and micro-interactions.
- A comprehensive settings and preferences system (the "Autonomy Sliders").
- Real-time inventory lookups via third-party API integration.
- A highly performant app with optimized data handling and rendering.

### Feature 1: UI/UX Refinement & Polish

1.  **Implement Micro-interactions:** Add subtle animations and transitions to button presses, screen loads, and list item appearances to make the app feel more responsive and alive.
2.  **Add Skeleton Loaders:** Replace blank loading screens with skeleton loaders that mimic the shape of the content being loaded, improving the perceived performance.
3.  **Refine Empty States:** Design and implement helpful and engaging empty states for all lists (e.g., "No jobs scheduled today. Add a new job?").
4.  **Enhance Error Handling:** Implement user-friendly error messages and modals for all potential failure points (e.g., network errors, API failures), providing clear guidance on how to resolve the issue.
5.  **Haptic Feedback:** Add subtle haptic feedback for key actions like confirming a schedule or completing a job to make interactions more tactile and satisfying.

### Feature 2: The "Autonomy Sliders" (Advanced Preferences)

1.  **Build Settings UI:** Create a dedicated Settings screen where users can manage their preferences.
2.  **Implement Priority Customization:** Allow users to define their own rules for what constitutes a `Demand` vs. `Maintenance` job, giving them control over the `Dispatch Strategist` agent's logic.
3.  **Implement Buffer Time Controls:** Add settings for users to specify their preferred buffers for travel time and job duration (e.g., "Always add 15% to Google Maps travel time").
4.  **Implement Work Schedule Manager:** Build a UI for users to define their exact working hours and break times for each day of the week, which the routing engine will honor.
5.  **Persist All Settings:** Ensure all these preferences are saved to Supabase and are used by the agentic crew during the planning process.

### Feature 3: Real-Time Inventory & Third-Party Integrations

1.  **Select Supplier API:** Research and select an initial hardware supplier API (e.g., Lowe's, Grainger) for real-time stock checks.
2.  **Build API Service:** In `/services`, create a new service file to handle all interactions with the selected third-party API.
3.  **Integrate API as a Tool:** Make the new service available as a tool for the `Inventory & Prep Specialist` agent.
4.  **Update Agent Prompt:** Modify the agent's prompt to instruct it to use the new tool to verify part availability and include store locations in the "Hardware Store Run" job.
5.  **Display Stock Information in UI:** Update the inventory checklist UI to show real-time stock status and location for items on the shopping list.

### Feature 4: Performance & Optimization

1.  **Optimize List Rendering:** Replace `FlatList` with `FlashList` for all long lists of data to improve scrolling performance and reduce memory usage.
2.  **Memoize Components:** Profile the application for unnecessary re-renders and wrap expensive components in `React.memo` where appropriate.
3.  **Implement Map Clustering:** For the map view, implement pin clustering to gracefully handle days with a large number of jobs without lagging the UI.
4.  **Bundle Size Analysis:** Use tools to analyze the final app bundle size and identify opportunities to reduce it by removing unused code or dependencies.
5.  **Image Optimization:** Implement an image optimization pipeline to ensure any user-uploaded images are resized and compressed appropriately.

## Team Task Allocation
With a functional MVP in place, this phase is about refinement and adding layers of value. The tasks are more independent and can be distributed based on interest and context.

*   **Lead Developer(s):** Jack (UI Polish), Trevor (Settings), Jeremiah (Integrations), Josh (Performance)
*   **Rationale:** The team is now solidifying the product. Each developer takes ownership of a distinct feature that enhances the user experience or technical robustness.

| Task / Feature | Swimlane | Suggested Owner(s) | Rationale & Collaboration |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Feature 1: UI/UX Refinement & Polish** | Frontend & UI/UX | **Jack** | This is a pure frontend task focused on making the application *feel* great. Jack can focus on animations, loaders, and haptics across the entire app, building on the components he and Trevor created. |
| **Feature 2: The "Autonomy Sliders"** | Frontend & Backend | **Trevor** | This is a perfect "full-stack" feature. Trevor would build the UI for the settings screen and also the logic to save these preferences to Supabase and ensure the agents use them. It's a self-contained feature that touches both front and back ends. |
| **Feature 3: Real-Time Inventory & 3rd-Party APIs** | AI & Routing | **Jeremiah** | This task builds directly on the agentic work from Phase 2. Jeremiah can extend the `Inventory & Prep Specialist` agent with new tools for calling external APIs, keeping all agent-related logic with one owner. |
| **Feature 4: Performance & Optimization** | Platform | **Josh** | Having built the data layer, Josh has a deep understanding of where potential bottlenecks might be. He can focus on profiling the app, optimizing lists with `FlashList`, implementing map clustering, and ensuring the app is fast and efficient. |
