# Phase 3: Polish & Advanced Features

## ðŸŽ¯ Goal
To elevate the MVP into a polished, delightful, and production-ready application. This phase focuses on refining the user experience, improving performance, adding advanced "autonomy" features, and ensuring the application is robust and scalable.

##  deliverables
- A refined and delightful user interface with smooth transitions and micro-interactions.
- A comprehensive settings and preferences system (the "Autonomy Sliders").
- Real-time inventory lookups via third-party API integration.
- A highly performant app with optimized data handling and rendering.

### Feature 1: UI/UX Refinement & Polish

1.  **Implement Micro-interactions:** Add subtle animations and transitions to button presses, screen loads, and list item appearances to make the app feel more responsive and alive.
2.  **Add Skeleton Loaders:** Replace blank loading screens with skeleton loaders that mimic the shape of the content being loaded, improving the perceived performance.
3.  **Refine Empty States:** Design and implement helpful and engaging empty states for all lists (e.g., "No jobs scheduled today. Add a new job?").
4.  **Enhance Error Handling:** Implement user-friendly error messages and modals for all potential failure points (e.g., network errors, API failures), providing clear guidance on how to resolve the issue.
5.  **Haptic Feedback:** Add subtle haptic feedback for key actions like confirming a schedule or completing a job to make interactions more tactile and satisfying.

### Feature 2: The "Autonomy Sliders" (Settings & Preferences UI)

1.  **Build Settings UI:** Create a dedicated, polished Settings screen where users can view and **edit** all the preferences that were initially set during the Phase 2 onboarding flow.
2.  **Implement Priority Customization UI:** Build the interface for users to modify their rules for `Demand` vs. `Maintenance` jobs.
3.  **Implement Buffer Time Controls UI:** Build the interface for users to adjust their preferred buffers for travel and job durations.
4.  **Implement Work Schedule Manager UI:** Build a polished UI for users to update their working hours and break times for each day of the week.
5.  **Persist All Settings:** Ensure any changes made in the Settings UI are correctly saved to Supabase and are immediately available to the agentic crew.

### Feature 3: Real-Time Inventory & Third-Party Integrations

1.  **Select Supplier API:** Research and select an initial hardware supplier API (e.g., Lowe's, Grainger) for real-time stock checks.
2.  **Build API Service:** In `/services`, create a new service file to handle all interactions with the selected third-party API.
3.  **Integrate API as a Tool:** Make the new service available as a tool for the `Inventory & Prep Specialist` agent.
4.  **Update Agent Prompt:** Modify the agent's prompt to instruct it to use the new tool to verify part availability and include store locations in the "Hardware Store Run" job.
5.  **Display Stock Information in UI:** Update the inventory checklist UI to show real-time stock status and location for items on the shopping list.

### Feature 4: Performance & Optimization

1.  **Optimize List Rendering:** Replace `FlatList` with `FlashList` for all long lists of data to improve scrolling performance and reduce memory usage.
2.  **Memoize Components:** Profile the application for unnecessary re-renders and wrap expensive components in `React.memo` where appropriate.
3.  **Implement Map Clustering:** For the map view, implement pin clustering to gracefully handle days with a large number of jobs without lagging the UI.
4.  **Bundle Size Analysis:** Use tools to analyze the final app bundle size and identify opportunities to reduce it by removing unused code or dependencies.
5.  **Image Optimization:** Implement an image optimization pipeline to ensure any user-uploaded images are resized and compressed appropriately.

### Feature 5: AI-Powered Job Creation

1.  **Build NLP Service:** Create a new service that takes a natural language string from the user.
2.  **Implement LLM-based Parsing:** Use an LLM (e.g., GPT-4o) within the service to parse the string and extract structured data (e.g., address, client name, parts required, requested time).
3.  **Integrate into Job Creation UI:** Update the "Add New Job" screen. Allow the user to type their request in a single text field.
4.  **Auto-populate and Verify:** When the user is done typing, call the NLP service and use the structured output to auto-populate the form fields. The user can then verify and correct the data before saving, keeping them in the loop.

### Feature 6: Implement Offline-First Data Synchronization

1.  **Select Offline Strategy:** Research and select an appropriate offline-first library or strategy (e.g., WatermelonDB, or a custom optimistic UI with a queueing system using MMKV).
2.  **Refactor Core Services:** Update the core data services to write changes (job status updates, inventory usage) to a local queue first before attempting to sync with Supabase.
3.  **Implement Background Sync Service:** Create a background service that detects when the device is online and automatically pushes the queued changes to the backend.
4.  **Handle Sync Conflicts:** Implement a basic strategy for handling potential data synchronization conflicts.

### Feature 7: Advanced Schedule Management Interface

1.  **Upgrade to Calendar UI:** Replace the list-based schedule view with a full, interactive calendar interface using `react-native-big-calendar`.
2.  **Enable Advanced Views:** Implement weekly and monthly planning views to provide users with a broader look at their schedule.

### Feature 8: Agent Self-Improvement via In-Context Learning
Implement an advanced feedback loop where the agent learns from user behavior. Instead of just verifying a plan, every user interaction becomes a training example.

1.  **Log User Feedback:** Systematically capture every user approval (positive example) and modification (corrective example) of the AI-generated plans.
2.  **Create Example Injection Service:** Build a service that retrieves the most relevant positive and corrective examples from the feedback log.
3.  **Enhance Agent Prompts:** Update the core agent prompts to include a section for these dynamic, in-context examples, allowing the LLM to infer user preferences rather than being given hardcoded rules.

## Team Task Allocation
With a functional MVP in place, this phase is about refinement and adding layers of value. The tasks are more independent and can be distributed based on individual ownership of a distinct feature, allowing for parallel, conflict-free development.

| Feature & Core Task | Domain | Owner | Rationale |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **F1: UI/UX Refinement & Polish** | Frontend & UI/UX | **Josh** | This is a pure frontend task focused on making the application *feel* great. Josh will conduct an app-wide pass to implement all micro-interactions, skeleton loaders, and haptic feedback, touching many components but in a superficial way that avoids deep logic conflicts. |
| **F2, F4, F6, F7: Frontend App & Architecture** <br/> â€¢ Settings/Autonomy Sliders <br/> â€¢ Performance & Optimization <br/> â€¢ Offline-First Sync (Client-side) <br/> â€¢ Calendar Schedule View | Frontend & UI/UX | **Jack** | This package covers all major client-side architecture and feature upgrades. Jack owns the app's performance, offline capabilities, and the most complex new UIs, solidifying his role as the Frontend Application Lead. |
| **F3, F5, F8: Advanced AI Services** <br/> â€¢ 3rd-Party API Integration <br/> â€¢ AI-Powered Job Creation <br/> â€¢ Agent Self-Improvement (Logic) | AI & Backend | **Jeremiah** | This package focuses on enhancing the app's intelligence. Jeremiah will own the creation of new AI-powered services and the implementation of the adaptive learning logic for the core agents. |
| **F6 & F8: Backend Architecture & Data Integrity** <br/> â€¢ Offline-First Sync (Backend & Conflicts) <br/> â€¢ Agent Self-Improvement (Feedback Logging) | Platform & Backend | **Trevor** | This package contains deep, architectural work critical for a production app. Trevor owns the backend data synchronization logic and the foundational data capture required for agent learning, supporting the other leads. |
