# Phase 3: Polish & Advanced Features

## ðŸŽ¯ Goal
To elevate the MVP into a polished, delightful, and production-ready application. This phase focuses on refining the user experience, improving performance, adding advanced "autonomy" features, and ensuring the application is robust and scalable.

##  deliverables
- A refined and delightful user interface with smooth transitions and micro-interactions.
- A comprehensive settings and preferences system (the "Autonomy Sliders").
- Real-time inventory lookups via third-party API integration.
- A highly performant app with optimized data handling and rendering.

### Feature 1: UI/UX Refinement & Polish (Josh)

1.  **Add Skeleton Loaders:** Replace blank loading screens with skeleton loaders that mimic the shape of the content being loaded, improving the perceived performance.
2.  **Enhance Error Handling:** Implement user-friendly error messages and modals for all potential failure points (e.g., network errors, API failures), providing clear guidance on how to resolve the issue.
3.  **Haptic Feedback:** Add subtle haptic feedback for key actions like confirming a schedule or completing a job to make interactions more tactile and satisfying.
4.  **Persist All Settings:** Ensure any changes made in the Settings UI are correctly saved to Supabase and are immediately available to the agentic crew.

### Feature 2: Real-Time Inventory & Third-Party Integrations (Jeremiah)

1.  **Select Supplier API:** Research the Lowe's and/or Home Depot hardware supplier API for real-time stock checks.
2.  **Build API Service:** In `/services`, create a new service file to handle all interactions with the selected third-party API.
3.  **Integrate API as a Tool:** Make the new service available as a tool for the `Inventory & Prep Specialist` agent.
4.  **Update Agent Prompt:** Modify the agent's prompt to instruct it to use the new tool to verify part availability and include store locations in the "Hardware Store Run" job.

### Feature 3: Implement Offline-First Data Synchronization (Jack + Trevor)

**Jack - Client-side Offline Implementation:**
1.  **Select Offline Strategy:** Research and select an appropriate offline-first library or strategy (e.g., WatermelonDB, or a custom optimistic UI with a queueing system using MMKV).
2.  **Refactor Core Services:** Update the core data services to write changes (job status updates, inventory usage) to a local queue first before attempting to sync with Supabase.
3.  **Implement Background Sync Service:** Create a background service that detects when the device is online and automatically pushes the queued changes to the backend.

**Trevor - Backend & Conflict Resolution:**
4.  **Handle Sync Conflicts:** Implement a basic strategy for handling potential data synchronization conflicts.

### Feature 4: Advanced Schedule Management Interface (Jack)

1.  **Enable Advanced Views:** Implement weekly and monthly planning views to provide users with a broader look at their schedule.

### Feature 5: Agent Self-Improvement via In-Context Learning (Jeremiah)

**Agent Learning Logic:**
1.  **Create Example Injection Service:** Build a service that analyzes user modifications to AI-generated plans and creates examples for prompt enhancement.
2.  **Enhance Agent Prompts:** Update the core agent prompts to include dynamic, preference-based examples that allow the LLM to infer user preferences rather than being given hardcoded rules.
3.  **Pattern Recognition:** Implement logic to detect user preference patterns from plan modifications and integrate them into agent decision-making.

## Team Task Allocation
With a functional MVP in place, this phase is about refinement and adding layers of value. The tasks are more independent and can be distributed based on individual ownership of a distinct feature, allowing for parallel, conflict-free development.

| Feature & Core Task | Domain | Owner | Rationale |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **F1: UI/UX Refinement & Polish** | Frontend & UI/UX | **Josh** | This is a pure frontend task focused on making the application *feel* great. Josh will conduct an app-wide pass to implement skeleton loaders, error handling, and haptic feedback, touching many components but in a superficial way that avoids deep logic conflicts. |
| **F3, F4: Frontend App & Architecture** <br/> â€¢ Offline-First Sync (Client-side) <br/> â€¢ Advanced Schedule Management Interface | Frontend & UI/UX | **Jack** | This package covers major client-side architecture upgrades. Jack owns the app's offline capabilities and advanced calendar views, solidifying his role as the Frontend Application Lead. |
| **F2, F5: Advanced AI Services** <br/> â€¢ Real-Time Inventory & Third-Party Integrations <br/> â€¢ Agent Self-Improvement via In-Context Learning | AI & Backend | **Jeremiah** | This package focuses on enhancing the app's intelligence. Jeremiah will own the creation of new AI-powered services and the implementation of the adaptive learning logic for the core agents. |
| **F3: Backend Architecture & Data Integrity** <br/> â€¢ Offline-First Sync (Backend & Conflicts) | Platform & Backend | **Trevor** | This package contains deep, architectural work critical for a production app. Trevor owns the backend data synchronization logic and conflict resolution strategies. |
