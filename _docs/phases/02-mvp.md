# Phase 2: MVP - The Core AI Workflow

## ðŸŽ¯ Goal
To build and integrate the core, end-to-end AI-powered daily planning workflow. This phase delivers the "magic" of the application: a user can open the app, have their day planned by AI, and see the results on a map.

##  deliverables
- A functional user authentication and onboarding flow.
- A live, three-step "Plan Your Day" feature powered by a LangGraph agent crew.
- AI-powered spatial reasoning for route optimization using coordinate analysis.
- A map view that visualizes the AI-generated route.

### Feature 1: User Authentication & Onboarding (Josh)

1.  **Build Auth Screens:** Create the UI for the Sign In and Sign Up screens.
2.  **Integrate Auth Service:** Connect the UI to the `services/auth.ts` functions.
3.  **Implement Session Management:** Ensure the user's session is persisted.
4.  **Create Onboarding Flow:** Build a multi-step onboarding process to capture all initial "Autonomy Slider" preferences:
    *   Work Schedule (Days, hours, breaks).
    *   Default Time Buffers (Travel and job duration).
    *   Demand Job Response Time rules.
    *   Preferred Hardware Suppliers.
5.  **Store User Preferences:** Save all onboarding data to the appropriate tables in Supabase.

### Feature 2: Data Fetching & Management (Trevor)

**Architectural Rule:** TanStack Query will be the single source of truth for all **asynchronous server state** (e.g., jobs, inventory). Jotai will be used exclusively for **synchronous, client-side state** (e.g., UI theme, modal visibility, or managing the state of complex, multi-step forms before submission).

1.  **Integrate TanStack Query:** Add the library and wrap the root of the app in a `QueryClientProvider`.
2.  **Create Data Hooks:** Build custom hooks for fetching data from Supabase, abstracting away the query keys and logic (e.g., `useJobs()`, `useInventory()`).
3.  **Refactor Screens for Server State:** Replace any placeholder or Jotai-managed server data with live data from the `useJobs` hook.
4.  **Implement Mutations:** Build hooks for data modification (e.g., `useUpdateJob()`, `useCreateJob()`) and integrate them.

### Feature 3: AI Agent Crew & Spatial Reasoning (Jeremiah)

**Objective:** Build the complete AI-powered daily planning workflow using LangGraph agents with spatial reasoning for route optimization.

1.  **Implement LangGraph State Machine:** Build the core workflow orchestration using LangGraph with three specialized agents:
    *   **Dispatch Strategist:** Job prioritization and scheduling
    *   **Route Optimizer:** AI-powered spatial reasoning for route optimization
    *   **Inventory Specialist:** Parts analysis and shopping list generation

2.  **Build AI Agent Prompt System:** Create comprehensive prompt templates for each agent:
    *   Dispatch reasoning prompts with business logic
    *   Spatial reasoning prompts for route optimization using coordinate analysis
    *   Inventory analysis prompts with parts knowledge

3.  **Implement Coordinate-Based Route Optimization:** Replace external routing engines with AI spatial reasoning:
    *   Simple coordinate formatting tools for agent input
    *   GPT-4o spatial reasoning for optimal route determination
    *   Zero external dependencies - pure AI-powered optimization

4.  **Build Agent-Database Integration:** Connect agents to Supabase for state persistence:
    *   Real-time workflow state tracking
    *   Agent output storage and retrieval
    *   Human-in-the-loop verification support

5.  **Deploy Agents as Supabase Edge Functions:** Deploy the LangGraph workflow to Supabase Edge Functions for serverless execution.

### Feature 4: Agent Prompt Optimization (Continued)

1.  **Optimize Spatial Reasoning Prompts:** Fine-tune the Route Optimizer agent prompts:
    *   Enhance geographic analysis instructions
    *   Improve coordinate processing guidance
    *   Refine route efficiency algorithms in prompt form

2.  **Implement Agent Performance Monitoring:** Track agent execution metrics:
    *   Response time optimization
    *   Decision quality scoring
    *   Error rate monitoring

### Feature 5: The "Plan Your Day" UI (Josh)

1.  **Build Schedule Review UI:** Create the screen where the user is presented with the AI-generated job list. Implement drag-and-drop functionality using a **list-based component (e.g., `react-native-draggable-flatlist`)** for the user to reorder the list.
2.  **Handle User Approval:** When the user hits "Confirm Schedule," send the (potentially reordered) list back to the LangGraph agent to proceed to the next step.
3.  **Build Map View UI:** Create the screen to display the optimized route from the `Route Optimizer`. Use `react-native-maps` to draw the polyline and place markers for each job.
4.  **Build Inventory Checklist UI:** Create the final screen in the flow, which displays the parts manifest from the `Inventory & Prep Specialist` as a simple checklist.
5.  **Connect the Full Flow:** Tie all the UI steps together, driven by the state of the LangGraph agent via the Supabase real-time subscription.
6.  **Implement Error Handling UI:** Design and build a generic error state component for the AI planning flow. The UI must catch errors from the agent execution and display this state, providing a clear message and a "Retry" option for the user.

### Feature 6: Full Data Management (Jack)

1.  **Build Job Management UI:** Create a dedicated screen for full CRUD operations on jobs.
2.  **Build Inventory Management UI:** Create a dedicated screen for full CRUD operations on inventory items.
3.  **Implement Image Upload:** In the Inventory Management UI, add functionality for users to upload an image for each inventory item.
4.  **Integrate Data Mutations:** Connect the new UIs to the necessary TanStack Query mutation hooks.

### Feature 7: Dynamic Replanning & In-Field Updates (Jack)

1.  **Develop Change Detection Trigger:** Implement a listener that detects when a job in an active daily plan is created, updated (e.g., rescheduled), or cancelled.
2.  **Build Re-planning UI Flow:** Create the UI prompts to ask the user if they want to re-plan their day when a change is detected.
3.  **Implement Re-planning Logic:** Connect the trigger to the LangGraph agent, allowing it to re-run the dispatch and routing sequence with the updated job list while preserving the state of completed jobs.
4.  **Integrate with Map View:** Ensure the map view dynamically updates to reflect the new, re-optimized route.



### Feature 9: In-Field Execution UI (Josh)

1.  **Job Progress Tracking:** Real-time job status updates and completion tracking.
2.  **Navigation Integration:** Connect with device navigation apps for turn-by-turn directions.
3.  **Inventory Usage Tracking:** Track parts used during job completion.

## Team Task Allocation

This is the most complex phase where the swimlanes become critical. The work is divided into four distinct, feature-based packages, allowing the team to build the app's core value proposition in parallel with minimal overlap.

| Package & Features | Domain | Owner | Rationale |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **The AI Core & Engine** <br/> â€¢ F3: AI Agent Crew <br/> â€¢ F4: Agent Prompt Optimization | AI & Backend | **Jeremiah** | This is a highly specialized work package. Jeremiah will own the "brain" of the app, from creating the LangGraph agents to implementing AI-powered spatial reasoning and architecting the real-time communication layer. |
| **The Backend Data Layer** <br/> â€¢ F2: TanStack Query <br/> â€¢ F4: Coordinate Service Integration | Backend & Data | **Trevor** | This package is focused on providing the application with its data. Trevor will own the entire data access layer, including building the coordinate service client and all TanStack Query hooks needed for the frontend to manage jobs. |
| **The Core User Experience UI** <br/> â€¢ F1: Auth & Onboarding <br/> â€¢ F5: Plan Your Day UI <br/> â€¢ F9: In-Field Execution UI | Frontend & UI/UX | **Josh** | This package covers the primary, sequential user journey. Josh will own the complete "happy path" UI, from logging in and setting preferences, to stepping through the AI plan, to executing the first job of the day. He will consume the services provided by Trevor and Jeremiah. |
| **Data Management & Dynamic UI** <br/> â€¢ F6: CRUD UIs <br/> â€¢ F7: Dynamic Replanning | Frontend & UI/UX | **Jack** | This package focuses on all the "management" and "reactive" parts of the UI. Jack will own the screens for manually managing jobs and inventory, as well as the UI triggers and modals required for the dynamic re-planning flow, ensuring a robust data management experience. |
