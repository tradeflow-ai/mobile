## ðŸŽ¯ Goal
To build and integrate the core, end-to-end AI-powered daily planning workflow. This phase delivers the "magic" of the application: a user can open the app, have their day planned by AI, and see the results on a map.

##  deliverables
- A functional user authentication and onboarding flow.
- A live, two-step "Plan Your Day" feature powered by specialized edge functions.
- AI-powered spatial reasoning for route optimization using coordinate analysis.
- A map view that visualizes the AI-generated route.

### Feature 1: User Authentication & Onboarding (Josh)

1.  **Build Auth Screens:** Create the UI for the Sign In and Sign Up screens.
2.  **Integrate Auth Service:** Connect the UI to the `services/auth.ts` functions.
3.  **Implement Session Management:** Ensure the user's session is persisted.
4.  **Create Onboarding Flow:** Build a multi-step onboarding process to capture all initial "Autonomy Slider" preferences:
    *   Work Schedule (Days, hours, breaks).
    *   Default Time Buffers (Travel and job duration).
    *   Demand Job Response Time rules.
    *   Preferred Hardware Suppliers.
5.  **Store User Preferences:** Save all onboarding data to the appropriate tables in Supabase.

### Feature 2: Data Fetching & Management (Trevor)

**Architectural Rule:** TanStack Query will be the single source of truth for all **asynchronous server state** (e.g., jobs, inventory, clients). Jotai will be used exclusively for **synchronous, client-side state** (e.g., UI theme, modal visibility, or managing the state of complex, multi-step forms before submission).

1.  **Integrate TanStack Query:** Add the library and wrap the root of the app in a `QueryClientProvider`.
2.  **Create Data Hooks:** Build custom hooks for fetching data from Supabase, abstracting away the query keys and logic (e.g., `useJobs()`, `useInventory()`).
3.  **Refactor Screens for Server State:** Replace any placeholder or Jotai-managed server data with live data from the `useJobs` hook.
4.  **Implement Mutations:** Build hooks for data modification (e.g., `useUpdateJob()`, `useCreateJob()`) and integrate them.

### Feature 3: AI Agent Crew & Spatial Reasoning (Jeremiah)

**Objective:** Build the complete AI-powered daily planning workflow using specialized edge functions with spatial reasoning for route optimization.

1.  **Implement 2-Step Edge Function Architecture:** Build the core workflow orchestration using two specialized edge functions:
    *   **Dispatcher Function:** Job prioritization and scheduling with spatial reasoning
    *   **Inventory Function:** Parts analysis and shopping list generation with hardware store job creation

2.  **Build AI Agent Prompt System:** Create comprehensive prompt templates for each function:
    *   Dispatcher reasoning prompts with business logic and spatial optimization
    *   Inventory analysis prompts with parts knowledge and supplier integration

3.  **Implement Coordinate-Based Route Optimization:** Use AI spatial reasoning for route optimization:
    *   Simple coordinate formatting tools for agent input
    *   GPT-4o spatial reasoning for optimal route determination
    *   Zero external dependencies - pure AI-powered optimization

4.  **Build Agent-Database Integration:** Connect functions to Supabase for state persistence:
    *   Real-time workflow state tracking through daily_plans table
    *   Agent output storage and retrieval
    *   Human-in-the-loop verification support between steps

5.  **Deploy Functions as Supabase Edge Functions:** Deploy the 2-step workflow to Supabase Edge Functions for serverless execution.

### Feature 4: Agent Prompt Optimization (Continued)

1.  **Optimize Spatial Reasoning Prompts:** Fine-tune the Route Optimizer agent prompts:
    *   Enhance geographic analysis instructions
    *   Improve coordinate processing guidance
    *   Refine route efficiency algorithms in prompt form

2.  **Validate Agent Decision Quality:** Test agent reasoning outputs:
    *   Dispatch prioritization logic validation
    *   Route optimization spatial accuracy
    *   Inventory analysis completeness

3.  **Implement Agent Performance Monitoring:** Track agent execution metrics:
    *   Response time optimization
    *   Decision quality scoring
    *   Error rate monitoring

### Feature 5: The "Plan Your Day" UI (Josh)

1.  **Build Schedule Review UI:** Create the screen where the user is presented with the AI-generated job list. Implement drag-and-drop functionality using a **list-based component (e.g., `react-native-draggable-flatlist`)** for the user to reorder the list.
2.  **Handle User Approval:** When the user hits "Confirm Schedule," trigger the inventory analysis step to proceed to the next phase.
3.  **Build Map View UI:** Create the screen to display the optimized route from the `Dispatcher Function`. Use `react-native-maps` to draw the polyline and place markers for each job.
4.  **Build Inventory Checklist UI:** Create the final screen in the flow, which displays the parts manifest from the `Inventory Function` as a simple checklist.
5.  **Connect the Full Flow:** Tie all the UI steps together, driven by the state of the edge functions via the Supabase real-time subscription.
6.  **Implement Error Handling UI:** Design and build a generic error state component for the AI planning flow. The UI must catch errors from the function execution and display this state, providing a clear message and a "Retry" option for the user.

### Feature 6: Full Data Management (Jack)

1.  **Build Job Management UI:** Create a dedicated screen for full CRUD operations on jobs.
2.  **Build Inventory Management UI:** Create a dedicated screen for full CRUD operations on inventory items.
3.  **Implement Image Upload:** In the Inventory Management UI, add functionality for users to upload an image for each inventory item.
4.  **Integrate Data Mutations:** Connect the new UIs to the necessary TanStack Query mutation hooks.

### Feature 7: Dynamic Replanning & In-Field Updates (Jack)

1.  **Develop Change Detection Trigger:** Implement a listener that detects when a job in an active daily plan is created, updated (e.g., rescheduled), or cancelled.
2.  **Build Re-planning UI Flow:** Create the UI prompts to ask the user if they want to re-plan their day when a change is detected.
3.  **Implement Re-planning Logic:** Connect the trigger to the edge functions, allowing them to re-run the dispatch and inventory sequence with the updated job list while preserving the state of completed jobs.
4.  **Integrate with Map View:** Ensure the map view dynamically updates to reflect the new, re-optimized route.

### Feature 8: Client Management (Trevor)

1.  **Client CRUD Operations:** Build full client management with TanStack Query integration.
2.  **Client-Job Association:** Connect clients to jobs with proper relationship management.
3.  **Client Contact Management:** Store and manage client contact preferences and history.

### Feature 9: In-Field Execution UI (Josh)

1.  **Job Progress Tracking:** Real-time job status updates and completion tracking.
2.  **Navigation Integration:** Connect with device navigation apps for turn-by-turn directions.
3.  **Inventory Usage Tracking:** Track parts used during job completion.

### Feature 10: BoM Management (Trevor)

1.  **Job Type Templates:** Create reusable job type definitions with standard parts lists.
2.  **BoM Association:** Within the Job Types UI, allow users to associate specific inventory items and their required quantities, creating a reusable Bill of Materials for each job type.
3.  **Update Seed Script:** Ensure the database seed script populates this data structure with sensible defaults that the user can later edit.
