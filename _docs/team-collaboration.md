### ü§ù Team Collaboration & Project Management
To ensure effective project management and equal contribution, our team will adhere to the following process:
- **Version Control:** We will use a `feature-branch` workflow. All code will be submitted through pull requests requiring at least one peer review before being rebased and merged into the `main` branch to maintain a clean history.
- **Task Management:** We will use GitHub Projects to manage our development backlog, assign clear tasks, and track progress through the development stages.
- **Roles & Responsibilities:** While all members will contribute to the codebase, we will designate leads for key architectural areas (e.g., Agentic Logic, UI/UX, API Integration) to ensure clear ownership and accountability.
