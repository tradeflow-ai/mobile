# TradeFlow: Current State & Architecture (January 2025)

## üöÄ Executive Summary

TradeFlow is a **production-ready**, **open source**, AI-powered mobile application that serves as an intelligent workflow optimizer for independent tradespeople. It acts as an "AI Admin" that automates and optimizes the complex, dynamic context of a contractor's day, maximizing revenue-generating "wrench time" while minimizing administrative overhead.

### Key Changes from Initial Vision
- **2 AI Agents** (down from 3): Dispatcher and Inventory Specialist
- **AI-Powered Routing**: Using GPT-4o spatial reasoning instead of VROOM/OSRM
- **Production Ready**: Comprehensive offline support, real-time sync, and enterprise-grade architecture
- **$0 Cost**: No external API dependencies for routing or location services
- **Open Source**: MIT licensed with community-driven development

## üéØ What TradeFlow Does

### Core Value Proposition
TradeFlow transforms chaotic daily workflows into intelligent, automated plans through a **2-step AI workflow**:

1. **The Dispatcher Agent**
   - Prioritizes jobs using business rules (Emergency ‚Üí Inspection ‚Üí Service)
   - Optimizes routes using GPT-4o spatial reasoning
   - Creates time-efficient daily schedules
   - Adapts to user preferences through machine learning

2. **The Inventory Specialist Agent**
   - Analyzes parts requirements for scheduled jobs
   - Checks current inventory levels
   - Creates shopping lists with cost estimates
   - Automatically generates hardware store jobs when needed
   - Inserts hardware store stops at optimal positions

### User Workflow
1. **Start Planning**: User selects pending jobs for the day
2. **AI Dispatch**: System prioritizes jobs and optimizes routes
3. **User Confirmation**: Review and approve job order
4. **Inventory Analysis**: System checks parts requirements
5. **Hardware Store Integration**: Automatically adds shopping stops if needed
6. **Execute Plan**: Navigate to jobs with integrated map apps

## üèóÔ∏è Technical Architecture

### AI Architecture: 2-Step Edge Functions

#### **Step 1: Dispatcher Function** (`/supabase/functions/dispatcher/`)
```typescript
// Unified agent handling both prioritization and routing
export class DispatcherAgent {
  // Business priority rules + Geographic optimization
  async execute(context: AgentContext): Promise<DispatchOutput> {
    // 1. Prioritize by business rules
    // 2. Optimize within priority tiers
    // 3. Return scheduled jobs with routes
  }
}
```

#### **Step 2: Inventory Function** (`/supabase/functions/inventory/`)
```typescript
export class InventoryAgent {
  // Parts analysis + Hardware store job creation
  async execute(context: InventoryAgentContext): Promise<InventoryOutput> {
    // 1. Analyze job requirements
    // 2. Check inventory levels
    // 3. Create shopping lists
    // 4. Generate hardware store job if needed
  }
}
```
