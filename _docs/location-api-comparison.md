## Technical Integration

### Google Places API Integration

```typescript
// Example: Hardware store search
const searchHardwareStores = async (location: {lat: number, lng: number}, radius: number) => {
  const response = await fetch(
    `https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/place/nearbysearch/json?` +
    `location=${location.lat},${location.lng}&` +
    `radius=${radius}&` +
    `type=hardware_store&` +
    `key=${GOOGLE_PLACES_API_KEY}`
  );
  return response.json();
};
```

### Mapbox Search Box Integration

```typescript
// Example: Search along route
const searchAlongRoute = async (route: string, query: string) => {
  const response = await fetch(
    `https://api.mapbox.com/search/searchbox/v1/category?` +
    `q=${query}&` +
    `route=${route}&` +
    `access_token=${MAPBOX_ACCESS_TOKEN}`
  );
  return response.json();
};
```

### Foursquare Places API Integration

```typescript
// Example: Place search
const searchPlaces = async (location: {lat: number, lng: number}, query: string) => {
  const response = await fetch(
    `https://api.foursquare.com/v3/places/search?` +
    `ll=${location.lat},${location.lng}&` +
    `query=${query}&` +
    `categories=17069`, // Hardware store category
    {
      headers: {
        'Authorization': `Bearer ${FOURSQUARE_API_KEY}`
      }
    }
  );
  return response.json();
};
```

## Risk Analysis

### Google Places API Risks
- **High cost** at scale
- **Vendor lock-in** risk
- **Complex pricing** structure
- **Rate limiting** concerns

### Mapbox Search Box Risks
- **Limited business data** for hardware stores
- **Newer API** with less proven track record
- **Less specialized** for retail discovery

### Foursquare Places API Risks
- **Smaller market share** than Google
- **Limited hardware store** categorization
- **Uncertain long-term** viability

## Conclusion

For TradeFlow's hardware store location suggestions, **Google Places API** offers the best combination of data quality, business information completeness, and hardware store coverage. While it's the most expensive option, the superior data quality justifies the cost for professional tradesman workflows.

**Mapbox Search Box** provides excellent value for route-based discovery and integrates well with existing mapping infrastructure. Consider it as a complementary service or primary choice if cost is the main concern.

**Foursquare Places API** serves as a solid backup option with competitive pricing at volume, though it lacks the specialized hardware store data quality of Google Places.

**Final Recommendation:** Implement Google Places API as primary with Mapbox Search Box as secondary for route-based searches, combined with aggressive caching strategies to optimize costs.
