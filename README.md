# TradeFlow: The AI-First OS for Tradespeople

TradeFlow is an industry-specific AI agent that brings the "Cursor experience" to independent tradespeople. It acts as an "AI Admin," intelligently automating and optimizing the complex, dynamic context of a contractor's day to maximize their revenue-generating "wrench time" and minimize administrative overhead.

## üéØ The Problem
Independent contractors are often bogged down by non-revenue-generating activities like scheduling, routing, and inventory management. This disorganization directly reduces their earning potential. TradeFlow is a lightweight, intelligent solution that optimizes their daily workflow without the complexity of enterprise-grade software.

## ‚ú® Core Features
The application's intelligence is powered by a **2-step edge function architecture** with user confirmation:

-   **The Dispatcher:** Analyzes all pending jobs and prioritizes them based on business rules (Emergency ‚Üí Inspection ‚Üí Service) with intelligent route optimization
-   **The Inventory Manager:** Analyzes parts requirements, creates shopping lists, and automatically generates hardware store jobs when needed

### üîß 2-Step Edge Function Architecture
The AI system uses two separate edge functions with user confirmation between steps:

1. **Dispatcher Function** (`supabase/functions/dispatcher/`)
   - Prioritizes jobs using business rules
   - Optimizes routes with GPT-4o spatial reasoning
   - Returns prioritized job list for user confirmation

2. **Inventory Function** (`supabase/functions/inventory/`)
   - Analyzes parts requirements for confirmed jobs
   - Creates shopping lists with cost estimates
   - Generates hardware store jobs when parts are needed
   - Inserts hardware store jobs at optimal position in job sequence

### üì± Mobile App Workflow
1. **Start Planning**: User selects jobs and initiates planning
2. **Dispatcher Results**: System shows prioritized job order
3. **User Confirmation**: User reviews and confirms job order
4. **Inventory Analysis**: System analyzes parts requirements
5. **Hardware Store Integration**: Automatically creates and inserts hardware store jobs
6. **Final Execution**: User receives optimized job list ready for execution

### üéØ Key Features
- **Business Priority Rules**: Emergency jobs first, then inspection, then service
- **Hardware Store Job Insertion**: Automatically inserted after emergency/inspection jobs, before service jobs
- **User Confirmation**: User can review and modify job order before inventory analysis
- **Parts Analysis**: Intelligent analysis of job requirements and inventory levels
- **Shopping List Generation**: Automated creation of shopping lists with cost estimates

    -   **‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL:** Configure environment variables in Supabase Edge Functions:
        - In Supabase Dashboard ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Edge Functions ‚Üí Environment Variables
        - Add: `OPENAI_API_KEY` = your OpenAI API key
4.  **Deploy and test Edge Functions:**
    ```bash
    # Deploy dispatcher function
    supabase functions deploy dispatcher
    
    # Deploy inventory function  
    supabase functions deploy inventory
    
    # Test the Dispatcher Function
    curl -X POST http://localhost:54321/functions/v1/dispatcher \
      -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
      -H "Authorization: Bearer $SUPABASE_ANON_KEY" \
      -d '{"userId": "test", "jobIds": ["job-1"], "planDate": "2024-12-21"}'
    
    # Test the Inventory Function
    curl -X POST http://localhost:54321/functions/v1/inventory \
      -H "Content-Type: application/json" \

## üîó API Endpoints

### Dispatcher Function
- **Endpoint**: `/functions/v1/dispatcher`
- **Method**: POST
- **Purpose**: Prioritize jobs and optimize routes
- **Input**: `{ userId, jobIds, planDate }`
- **Output**: `{ prioritized_jobs, optimization_summary }`

### Inventory Function
- **Endpoint**: `/functions/v1/inventory`
- **Method**: POST
- **Purpose**: Analyze parts requirements and create hardware store jobs
- **Input**: `{ userId, jobIds, dispatchOutput }`
- **Output**: `{ inventory_analysis, hardware_store_job? }`

## üìä Workflow States

The daily planning workflow uses these states:

1. `pending` - Initial state
2. `dispatcher_complete` - Dispatcher has prioritized jobs
3. `awaiting_confirmation` - Waiting for user confirmation
4. `inventory_analyzing` - Analyzing parts requirements
5. `inventory_complete` - Inventory analysis complete
6. `hardware_store_added` - Hardware store job created and inserted
7. `ready_for_execution` - Final state, ready for job execution
8. `approved` - User has approved the final plan

## üéØ Job Priority System

### Business Priority Tiers (High to Low)
1. **Emergency Jobs**: Urgent issues requiring immediate attention
2. **Inspection Jobs**: Scheduled inspections and maintenance
3. **Hardware Store Jobs**: Parts pickup (inserted automatically)
4. **Service Jobs**: Regular service calls and repairs

### Hardware Store Job Insertion Rules
- **Standard Case**: Insert after Emergency + Inspection jobs, before Service jobs
- **Emergency Case**: If emergency job needs immediate parts, hardware store goes first
- **Cost Optimization**: Consolidate multiple parts requirements into single store visit
