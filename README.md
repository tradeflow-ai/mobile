## üéØ The Problem
Independent contractors are often bogged down by non-revenue-generating activities like scheduling, routing, and inventory management. This disorganization directly reduces their earning potential. TradeFlow is a lightweight, intelligent solution that optimizes their daily workflow without the complexity of enterprise-grade software.

## ‚ú® Core Features
The application's intelligence is powered by a **2-step edge function architecture** with user confirmation:

-   **The Dispatcher:** Analyzes all pending jobs and prioritizes them based on business rules (Emergency ‚Üí Inspection ‚Üí Service) with intelligent route optimization
-   **The Inventory Manager:** Analyzes parts requirements, creates shopping lists, and automatically generates hardware store jobs when needed

### üîß 2-Step Edge Function Architecture
The AI system uses two separate edge functions with user confirmation between steps:

1. **Dispatcher Function** (`supabase/functions/dispatcher/`)
   - Prioritizes jobs using business rules
   - Optimizes routes with GPT-4o spatial reasoning
   - Returns prioritized job list for user confirmation

2. **Inventory Function** (`supabase/functions/inventory/`)
   - Analyzes parts requirements for confirmed jobs
   - Creates shopping lists with cost estimates
   - Generates hardware store jobs when parts are needed
   - Inserts hardware store jobs at optimal position in job sequence

### üì± Mobile App Workflow
1. **Start Planning**: User selects jobs and initiates planning
2. **Dispatcher Results**: System shows prioritized job order
3. **User Confirmation**: User reviews and confirms job order
4. **Inventory Analysis**: System analyzes parts requirements
5. **Hardware Store Integration**: Automatically creates and inserts hardware store jobs
6. **Final Execution**: User receives optimized job list ready for execution

### üéØ Key Features
- **Business Priority Rules**: Emergency jobs first, then inspection, then service
- **Hardware Store Job Insertion**: Automatically inserted after emergency/inspection jobs, before service jobs
- **User Confirmation**: User can review and modify job order before inventory analysis
- **Parts Analysis**: Intelligent analysis of job requirements and inventory levels
- **Shopping List Generation**: Automated creation of shopping lists with cost estimates

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack
Our architecture is designed to be robust, scalable, and AI-first.

- **Framework:** TypeScript, Node.js, React Native (with Expo)
- **State Management:** Jotai (UI State) & TanStack Query (Server State)
- **Backend & Database:** Supabase

## üìú Project Conventions
This is an AI-first codebase, which means it is built to be modular, scalable, and easy for both humans and AI agents to understand.

- **Documentation-Driven:** Our project's structure, rules, and development phases are thoroughly documented in the `/_docs` directory.
- **Strict Directory Structure:** We follow a strict, feature-based directory structure to ensure files are predictable and easy to locate.
- **Mandatory File & Function Commentation:** Every file must begin with a descriptive header, and every exported function must have a TSDoc block.

For a complete overview of our coding standards, UI/theme rules, and development phases, please review the documents in the `/_docs` directory.

- **Input**: `{ userId, jobIds, dispatchOutput }`
- **Output**: `{ inventory_analysis, hardware_store_job? }`

## üìä Workflow States

The daily planning workflow uses these states:

1. `pending` - Initial state
2. `dispatcher_complete` - Dispatcher has prioritized jobs
3. `awaiting_confirmation` - Waiting for user confirmation
4. `inventory_analyzing` - Analyzing parts requirements
5. `inventory_complete` - Inventory analysis complete
6. `hardware_store_added` - Hardware store job created and inserted
7. `ready_for_execution` - Final state, ready for job execution
8. `approved` - User has approved the final plan

## üéØ Job Priority System

### Business Priority Tiers (High to Low)
1. **Emergency Jobs**: Urgent issues requiring immediate attention
2. **Inspection Jobs**: Scheduled inspections and maintenance
3. **Hardware Store Jobs**: Parts pickup (inserted automatically)
4. **Service Jobs**: Regular service calls and repairs

### Hardware Store Job Insertion Rules
- **Standard Case**: Insert after Emergency + Inspection jobs, before Service jobs
- **Emergency Case**: If emergency job needs immediate parts, hardware store goes first
- **Cost Optimization**: Consolidate multiple parts requirements into single store visit
