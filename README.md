# TradeFlow: The AI-First OS for Tradespeople

TradeFlow is an industry-specific AI agent that brings the "Cursor experience" to independent tradespeople. It acts as an "AI Admin," intelligently automating and optimizing the complex, dynamic context of a contractor's day to maximize their revenue-generating "wrench time" and minimize administrative overhead.

## üéØ The Problem
Independent contractors are often bogged down by non-revenue-generating activities like scheduling, routing, and inventory management. This disorganization directly reduces their earning potential. TradeFlow is a lightweight, intelligent solution that optimizes their daily workflow without the complexity of enterprise-grade software.

## ‚ú® Core Features
The application's intelligence is powered by a collaborative crew of specialized AI agents, orchestrated by LangGraph:

-   **The Dispatch Strategist:** Analyzes all pending jobs and prioritizes them based on urgency and user-defined rules to create the most logical and profitable job sequence for the day.
-   **The Route Optimizer:** Takes the approved job list and calculates the most time and fuel-efficient travel route using a self-hosted VROOM routing engine.
-   **The Inventory & Prep Specialist:** Creates a manifest of all required parts for the day's jobs, cross-references it with on-hand inventory, and generates a precise shopping list.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack
Our architecture is designed to be robust, scalable, and AI-first.

- **Framework:** TypeScript, Node.js, React Native (with Expo)
- **State Management:** Jotai (UI State) & TanStack Query (Server State)
- **Backend & Database:** Supabase
- **AI Orchestration:** LangGraph
- **Language Model:** OpenAI GPT-4o
- **Proprietary Routing Engine:** VROOM & OSRM
- **Deployment:** Docker & AWS Lightsail (Routing Engine), EAS (Mobile App)

## üìú Project Conventions
This is an AI-first codebase, which means it is built to be modular, scalable, and easy for both humans and AI agents to understand.

- **Documentation-Driven:** Our project's structure, rules, and development phases are thoroughly documented in the `/_docs` directory.
- **Strict Directory Structure:** We follow a strict, feature-based directory structure to ensure files are predictable and easy to locate.
- **Mandatory File & Function Commentation:** Every file must begin with a descriptive header, and every exported function must have a TSDoc block.

For a complete overview of our coding standards, UI/theme rules, and development phases, please review the documents in the `/_docs` directory.
