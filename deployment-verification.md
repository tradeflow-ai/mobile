POST /functions/v1/dispatcher
Content-Type: application/json
Authorization: Bearer <token>

Input: {
  "userId": "string",
  "jobIds": ["string"],
  "planDate": "YYYY-MM-DD"
}

Expected Output: {
  "prioritized_jobs": [...],
  "optimization_summary": {...}
}
```

#### Inventory Function
```
POST /functions/v1/inventory  
Content-Type: application/json
Authorization: Bearer <token>

Input: {
  "userId": "string",
  "jobIds": ["string"],
  "dispatchOutput": {...}
}

Expected Output: {
  "inventory_analysis": {...},
  "hardware_store_job": {...}
}
```

### üéØ Business Logic Verification

### üöÄ Success Metrics

#### Deployment Success Rate
- **Overall**: 100% (2/2 functions deployed successfully)
- **Dispatcher**: ‚úÖ Success
- **Inventory**: ‚úÖ Success

#### Architecture Migration Success
- **Old System**: 1 LangGraph edge function removed
- **New System**: 2 independent edge functions deployed  
- **Prompts**: 100% preserved exactly as originally written
- **Mobile App**: 100% updated to new workflow

### üìà Next Steps

#### Production Readiness
