   - Factor in buffer stock for unexpected needs

3. **SHOPPING LIST OPTIMIZATION**
   - Prioritize items by urgency and availability
   - Group items by supplier or store location
   - Consider bulk purchasing opportunities
   - Factor in delivery times vs. immediate needs

4. **SUPPLIER INTEGRATION**
   - Check real-time stock availability at preferred suppliers
   - Compare pricing across multiple vendors

5. **CONTINGENCY PLANNING**

## OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS
Your analysis should provide:

1. **INVENTORY MANIFEST**
   - List of parts to bring from current stock
   - Quantities needed for each job
   - Usage tracking for inventory depletion
   - Critical items that must be confirmed before departure

2. **SHOPPING LIST**
   - Missing items that need to be purchased
   - Quantities required with small buffer
