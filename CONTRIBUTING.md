# Contributing to TradeFlow

Thank you for your interest in contributing to TradeFlow! We welcome contributions from the community and are excited to see what you'll build.

## 🎯 Project Overview

TradeFlow is an AI-powered workflow optimization tool for independent tradespeople. It brings the "Cursor experience" to contractors, helping them maximize revenue-generating "wrench time" by optimizing scheduling, routing, and inventory management.

## 🤝 How to Contribute

### Getting Started

1. **Fork the repository** and clone it locally
2. **Install dependencies**: `npm install`
3. **Set up your development environment** following the README instructions
4. **Create a feature branch** following our naming conventions

### Development Process

We follow a **feature-branch workflow** with the following conventions:

#### Branch Naming
- Feature branches: `feature/description-of-feature`
- Bug fixes: `fix/description-of-bug`
- Documentation: `docs/description-of-change`
- Phase-specific work: `feature/phase-XX-feature-name-owner`

#### Commit Messages
- Use clear, descriptive commit messages
- Start with a verb in present tense (e.g., "Add", "Fix", "Update")
- Reference issues when applicable (e.g., "Fix inventory sync issue #123")

### Code Standards

#### TypeScript & Code Quality
- **All code must be TypeScript** with proper type definitions
- **File naming conventions**:
  - React components: `PascalCase` (e.g., `JobCard.tsx`)
  - Hooks, utils, services: `camelCase` (e.g., `useJobs.ts`, `mapUtils.ts`)
- **File headers**: Every `.ts` and `.tsx` file must begin with a block comment explaining the file's purpose
- **Function documentation**: All exported functions must have TSDoc comments
- **File length limit**: No file should exceed 500 lines

#### Architecture Patterns
- **State Management**: Use Jotai for UI state, TanStack Query for server state
- **Component Structure**: 
  - `/components/ui/` - Primitive UI building blocks
  - `/components/` - Higher-level composed components
- **Services**: Abstract external API calls into `/services/` directory
- **No direct Supabase calls** from UI components - use service abstractions

#### UI/UX Standards
- **Design Philosophy**: "Friendly Professional" - trustworthy, clear, efficient
- **Colors**: Always use colors from `@/constants/Colors` - never hardcode colors
- **Components**: Check existing components in `/components/` and `/components/ui/` before creating new ones
- **Responsive Design**: Use `StyleSheet.create` for all styling
- **Accessibility**: Follow React Native accessibility guidelines

### Pull Request Process

1. **Create a feature branch** from `main`
2. **Make your changes** following our coding standards
3. **Test thoroughly** - ensure your changes don't break existing functionality
4. **Update documentation** if you're adding new features or changing APIs
5. **Submit a pull request** with:
   - Clear description of what you've changed
   - Screenshots for UI changes
   - Reference to any related issues

#### Pull Request Requirements
- **At least one peer review** required before merging
- **All CI checks must pass**
- **Branch must be up to date** with main before merging
- **Squash and rebase** - we maintain a clean git history

### Team Roles & Responsibilities

Our team is organized into four distinct domains:

### Development Phases

We're following a structured development approach:

1. **Phase 1**: Foundational Setup & Architecture
2. **Phase 2**: MVP - The Core AI Workflow
3. **Phase 3**: Polish & Advanced Features

Check the `_docs/phases/` directory for detailed phase specifications.

### Issue Guidelines

When creating issues:
- **Use our issue templates** for bug reports and feature requests
- **Provide clear reproduction steps** for bugs
- **Include relevant context** (device, OS, app version)
- **Search existing issues** before creating new ones

### Code Review Guidelines

When reviewing pull requests:
- **Check for architectural consistency** with our patterns
- **Verify TypeScript types** are properly defined
- **Test the changes** on your local environment
- **Provide constructive feedback** with specific suggestions
- **Approve only when ready** - don't approve placeholder PRs

### Security Guidelines

- **Never commit sensitive data** (API keys, passwords, etc.)
- **Use environment variables** for configuration
- **Follow Supabase RLS best practices**
- **Validate all user inputs**

### Performance Guidelines

- **Use FlatList or FlashList** for long lists
- **Memoize expensive components** with React.memo
- **Optimize map rendering** with clustering for large datasets
- **Follow React Native performance best practices**

### Testing (Future)

While E2E testing is deferred to Phase 3, we encourage:
- **Manual testing** of all changes
- **Cross-platform testing** (iOS/Android/Web)
- **Edge case testing** for user flows

## 🚀 Getting Help

- **Documentation**: Check the `_docs/` directory for detailed guides
- **Issues**: Search existing issues or create a new one
- **Architecture Questions**: Review `_docs/tech-stack.md` and `_docs/project-rules.md`
