## 🔧 New Architecture Overview

### **2-Step Edge Function Workflow**
```
User Selection → Dispatcher → User Confirmation → Inventory → Execution
```

### **Key Components**
1. **Dispatcher Function** (`/functions/v1/dispatcher`)
   - Prioritizes jobs using business rules (Emergency → Inspection → Service)
   - Optimizes routes with GPT-4o spatial reasoning
   - Returns prioritized job list for user confirmation

2. **Inventory Function** (`/functions/v1/inventory`)
   - Analyzes parts requirements for confirmed jobs
   - Creates shopping lists with cost estimates
   - Generates hardware store jobs when parts are needed
   - Inserts hardware store jobs at optimal position

### **Mobile App Workflow**
1. **Start Planning**: User selects jobs and initiates planning
2. **Dispatcher Results**: System shows prioritized job order
3. **User Confirmation**: User reviews and confirms job order
4. **Inventory Analysis**: System analyzes parts requirements
5. **Hardware Store Integration**: Automatically creates and inserts hardware store jobs
6. **Final Execution**: User receives optimized job list ready for execution

## 🎯 Business Rules Preserved

### **Job Priority System**
1. **Emergency Jobs**: Urgent issues requiring immediate attention
2. **Inspection Jobs**: Scheduled inspections and maintenance
3. **Hardware Store Jobs**: Parts pickup (inserted automatically)
4. **Service Jobs**: Regular service calls and repairs

### **Hardware Store Job Insertion Logic**
- **Standard Case**: Insert after Emergency + Inspection jobs, before Service jobs
- **Emergency Case**: If emergency job needs immediate parts, hardware store goes first
- **Optimization**: Group parts for multiple jobs into single store visit
